1. A philosophical viewpoint:
In the 1950 Turing Test, Alan Turing suggested that rather than asking  "can machines think?" we should ask if a computer is capable of performing tasks that would make it indistinguishable from a human.
This test assesses a machine's ability to mimic human speech, but it ignores deeper consciousness or self-awareness.
Functionalism: According to some philosophers, a machine might be said to "think" if it is able to mimic mental processes. For instance, studying or applying logical thinking.

2.From a technological standpoint:
Present-day AI Capabilities: While machines can learn from data, solve problems, and even simulate creativity (e.g., ChatGPT or DALL-E), they are devoid of emotions, subjective experience, and genuine comprehension.
Limitations: The artificial intelligence of today is based on algorithms and patterns; it lacks the consciousness, intention, and emotions that many people equate with "thinking."

3.Biological Viewpoint:
The biological makeup of the human brain, which processes information in ways that machines cannot fully imitate, is linked to human thought. 
The question of whether machines can ever develop a type of "thinking" that is on par with biological intelligence is still up for dispute.

Future Possibilities
If advancements in AI lead to artificial general intelligence (AGI), machines might one day demonstrate abilities that resemble independent thinking, creativity, and decision-making in ways indistinguishable from humans.
