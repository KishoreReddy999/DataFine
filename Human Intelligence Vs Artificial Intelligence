Based on the biological functions of the brain, human intelligence is a combination of creativity, problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and adaptability. It is dynamic and influenced by one's surroundings, culture, and life experiences. 
Contrarily, artificial intelligence (AI) is created by humans and is designed to mimic some characteristics of human thought. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is based on algorithms, data processing, and preset patterns, whereas human intelligence is fuelled by intuition, emotional depth, and creativity. 
The main distinction is that AI does not experience awareness, whereas humans do.

Learning is one of the pillars of intelligence. People often adjust to circumstances with minimal information because they learn by experience, curiosity, and emotions. 
AI, on the other hand, learns by machine learning and depends on large datasets and iterative training to get better. An AI need thousands of labelled images to accomplish the same task as a child, who may learn to recognize a dog from a small number of instances. 
Whereas AI frequently falters when faced with challenges outside its training, humans are adept at adjusting to novel, unfamiliar situations.

Emotional comprehension is a key distinction between artificial intelligence and intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the capacity of humans to manage social dynamics, empathize, and make emotionally driven decisions. 
AI, on the other hand, is incapable of feeling or fully comprehending the social and emotional environment; it may imitate empathy (such as virtual assistants expressing regret or sounding upbeat), but it lacks true emotional comprehension. 
This is why, in domains like therapy, education, and leadership that demand empathy, humans are still indispensable despite AI's computational prowess.

Another area where human intelligence frequently surpasses AI is creativity. Although AI is capable of producing language, music, and art—sometimes remarkably well—it does so by examining preexisting patterns and creating variants. 
However, human creativity is fuelled by emotions, imagination, and life experiences, and frequently produces genuinely original ideas. 
AI is capable of creating a Mozart-style symphony, for instance, but it is unable to feel the happiness or sorrow that motivates human artists to produce completely original and profoundly significant works of art.

Despite their differences, human intelligence and AI are increasingly converging. AI augments human intelligence by analyzing vast amounts of data, automating tasks, and uncovering insights that would be impossible for humans alone.
For instance, AI assists doctors in diagnosing diseases, engineers in designing solutions, and businesses in predicting trends. 
However, this collaboration also raises ethical questions: as AI grows more advanced, how do we ensure it serves humanity rather than replacing or overshadowing it?
The interplay between human intelligence and AI is not a competition but a partnership that, if managed wisely, could redefine what it means to be intelligent.
